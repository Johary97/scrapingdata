They were still on the check but removed after my comment that we did not have them. My wife and I waited over one hour on our food. Generally, the waiter needed being reminded of everything albeit being very friendly. The senior colleague/ manager (?) was great though and everybody is entitled to a bad day once in a while but if you sell steaks for around 100 USD this is more difficult to accept than in some diner.",

My coworker and I were excited to have lunch there as the weather got warmer. Firstly, the glassware on our table was filthy. They moved our seat, unnecessary but we welcomed the offer. We ordered two of the same lunch menu items and upgraded to truffle fries. My coworker complained that the fries weren\u2019t cooked. I didn\u2019t share her sentiment until I bit into one of my own and found that the fry was in fact not cooked through. From then on it was hit or miss as to which fry was cooked through. A waiter (not our tables waiter) who I knew from another dining experience spoke with a manager for us. They offered a new order of fries. What came was fries that were scorching hot and practically burnt. I\u2019ve had their truffle fries in the past\u2026 and they were cooked all the way through and not burnt. I was so displeased that I didn\u2019t even finish my sandwich. Overall it wasn\u2019t a pleasant lunch. I judged my brunch experience in meatpacking harshly thinking it was unique to that location. Apparently the lack of attention to detail and basic care in preparing food is across the board for their NYC locations.",

We get there 15 mins before our reservations and ended up waiting 45 mins to an hour just to be seated. The waiter / servers / managers kept moving us around asking to stand in different places because we\u2019re in the way. Some were more rude than others. When we sat down things were a little better. Food arrived pretty quickly. Our bill was about $700 so to be treated the way were was horrible. I will never go to a STK in New York ever again",

I have worked in midtown and in the restaurant industry for 13 years. My dad is a bit handicapped and hard for him to walk and the amount of times we were cut off by staff and no allowed to walk first was surprising. Kahn seemed to be pretty clueless from the beginning, we always had empty glasses of wine, I ordered shellfish, apps and entrees and had a conversation where he asked if we wanted to do 3 courses I said shellfish and also can come together then entrees. When the food came everything came at the same time. Shellfish/apps/entrees, I told Kahn about it and his response was \u201coh yeah I see that\u201d with in 30 minutes of being sat we were on entrees. We weren\u2019t even given different share plates so we were eating the filet mignon and pork with the plates covered in cocktail sauce and oyster juice. To say I was livid is an understatement as I was there to celebrate a bday and I put that in the notes but when I ordered dessert so candle or any acknowledgement about that either. At the price point this restaurant is at they should 100% have higher standards. 5 adults 1 kid bill was over 1k so we we spending money and probably would\u2019ve spent more of wine wasn\u2019t on empty all dinner. I will never be back.",

The menus were left on the table with no explanation as to how anything worked for tea or your choices. Very few waiters seemed to be working and mostly bus boys who just dropped food dishes off.

Tea sandwiches looked like camp sandwiches, very simple crust cut off white bread\u2014not what you expect for 95 dollars a person. Had to wait 20 minutes for a glass of wine while food sat in front of us. Combination of mediocre food and poor service was not worth the high prices.",

It was grilled with the head on and that\u2019s it. There was no love or effort placed into cooking the food. The broccoli was under cooked and very hard to chew.

Duck was plated beautifully and very flavorful. The lambhowever, didn't taste the best as it was bland, the combo of chick peas and mash potatoes wasn't it. I brought it up to the manager and he delightfully took out the lamb out of my receipt and let me choose something else. He also provided a small,nice anniversary dessert.

But we did ok to talk. What struck me was the attentive service displayed by ALL the staff. Nobody walked by our table without looking over to see if we needed anything. They didn\u2019t always speak or bother us but you could tell they were attentive and quietly without asking a fresh plate would arrive, more water. It really felt like they worked as a team.",

We think there were too many guests for them to accommodate, so we would prefer another Brazilian place we went to last year in NYC.  We got to try all the different meats and the birthday guests received a cake as well.  They did not honor our request for a more private table and did not also acknowledge the birthdays.

The service was amazing! Someone was always available to help you. The only downside I would say is the waiting to be seated was disappointing. We came 30 mins before our reservation and we were seated about 35 minutes after we came. A bunch of people that came on time for their reservation were seated late so my advice is come early!!! It was well worth the wait!!!",

They paid zero attention. There are few appetizer choices, and each is huge (no complaints about portion size), so we chose the stuffed artichoke. It was inedible. The stuffing was an uncooked mess and the artichoke was devoid of edible parts.  The veal marsaIa was okay, but nothing to write home about. The broccoli was pretty good.

We ordered two of the same lunch menu items and upgraded to truffle fries. My coworker complained that the fries weren\u2019t cooked. I didn\u2019t share her sentiment until I bit into one of my own and found that the fry was in fact not cooked through. From then on it was hit or miss as to which fry was cooked through. A waiter (not our tables waiter) who I knew from another dining experience spoke with a manager for us. They offered a new order of fries. What came was fries that were scorching hot and practically burnt. I\u2019ve had their truffle fries in the past\u2026 and they were cooked all the way through and not burnt. I was so displeased that I didn\u2019t even finish my sandwich. Overall it wasn\u2019t a pleasant lunch. I judged my brunch experience in meatpacking harshly thinking it was unique to that location.

Two points about our visit yesterday....the service provided by our waiter was not good - appetizers came with the entrees and he was happy to argue with us when we said that wasn't what we expected, he had to be reminded to bring extra drinks that we had ordered a couple of times, and generally we felt that he was trying to rush us through dinner, which for us was a 50th birthday celebration.  Not what you would expect from a quality steak house.  Secondly, the music was very loud, felt that it could have been a little quieter that early in the evening.",

I have worked in midtown and in the restaurant industry for 13 years. My dad is a bit handicapped and hard for him to walk and the amount of times we were cut off by staff and no allowed to walk first was surprising. Kahn seemed to be pretty clueless from the beginning, we always had empty glasses of wine, I ordered shellfish, apps and entrees and had a conversation where he asked if we wanted to do 3 courses I said shellfish and also can come together then entrees. When the food came everything came at the same time. Shellfish/apps/entrees, I told Kahn about it and his response was \u201coh yeah I see that\u201d with in 30 minutes of being sat we were on entrees. We weren\u2019t even given different share plates so we were eating the filet mignon and pork with the plates covered in cocktail sauce and oyster juice. To say I was livid is an understatement as I was there to celebrate a bday and I put that in the notes but when I ordered dessert so candle or any acknowledgement about that either. At the price point this restaurant is at they should 100% have higher standards. 5 adults 1 kid bill was over 1k so we we spending money and probably would\u2019ve spent more of wine wasn\u2019t on empty all dinner.

And everything was cold. Awful. Service was even worse, if possible. The server asked if we wanted food to be served in a particular way, we asked to get oysters first, he brought the soup instead. I asked for a change in my cocktail, he said no problem, but then brought the original cocktail instead. He brought us oysters from east and west coast (we asked from west coast only) and was not acknowledging that. And on top of it, greatly overprice. Definitely NOT recommending it, it's a tourists' trap.",

I was charged full price for my dinner.  When we mentioned to the waiter that this was not the correct way to handle this situation and that one of my alcoholic beverages should have not been changed for he merely stated that this was out of his control.

Maybe there are not too many brunch places  around Lincoln center and the price point is acceptable. The bartender was outright yelling at people as we waited for our table that the bar seats were saved for people who want to eat at the bar. He was frankly a HUGE and unfriendly bummer.

As a former nurse at Metropolitan hospital I planned celebratory dinners and continued the tradition until i retired from Bellevue hospital. The food is excellent, served on platters to share. professional and helpful staff. Last night when my friend collapsed in the dining room, the staff immediately jumped into action, especially the manager and our waitress. Other staff stopped by to offer assistance. It reminded me of an emergency room scene and i know because six of the diners are Nurses, including the person who needed emergency assistance.

The food was AMAZING, the staff was very friendly and the ambience was nice. \nMy only complaint was that the service was pretty slow.  When we got seated, the place wasn't too busy, there were a lot of empty tables.  Though, in the next hour, the place was PACKED!  But even when it wasn't packed, we found the service to be slow.  After we placed our order, we waited a while for the food to come.  My husband ordered their Titanic dessert for my brother's bday while we were having our entrees.  After we finished eating, the tables were cleared out in a few minutes and we got takeout boxes but then a few minutes passed and I asked our waiter about the dessert, he nodded to acknowledge my ask.  It had been a good 15m, there was nothing, we were just sitting there idle waiting for the dessert.  I asked him about it again and he said he told them in the kitchen, should be out soon, and it finally arrived in the next 5-7m.  \nOther than the slow service, everything was excellent!  I would still go there again and recommend it to everyone!",

I looked on Open Table and I was able to immediately book reservations. OpenTable had openings for 8:00, 8:15, 8:30 and 9:00. I made a reservation for 8:00 and informed the hostess that I made a reservations. I asked to be seated with my reservation at one of the several open tables and hostess refused. While we were waiting one came into the restaurant who needed to be seated. When we were finally seated, we saw even more open seating. I took pictures of two open tables near me that remained open the entire night and there were even more open seats that remained seats. Luckily our server was attentive and the food was decent.

We were seated nearby the door to deck.  Nice view but if the door does not close all the way when  people exit the people seating nearby are hit with Arctic air.

Most service staff are attentive, but we experienced on multiple occasions careless mistakes with food and drink orders.  Last night one waitress mixed up the drink orders by bringing another tables\u2019 drinks to us only to return minutes later to attempt to take back and deliver them to the other table even after we told her we already drank from the glasses to taste.  We prevented her from doing this to the other table.  They always charge 18% gratuity regardless of table size (2 or 4). Last night was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.  Despite a ridiculous $640 + bill for a party of 4, our waitress charged us for one of the wrong drinks we sent back after her mix up.  Rather than do the customary thing to take the wrong drink off the bill, she left in!  We brought it up nicely and she refused to take it off.  After I said \u201cwe just won\u2019t ever come back here again\u201d she changed her tune and took it off.  It wasn\u2019t about the $20 drink, but the principle that this establishment does not understand customer service.  Which is probably why the majority of patrons we see go only to order a drink or two, a couple of appetizers and to smoke hookahs.\nWe are never going back again.",

For appetizers we had yuca frita and chorizo which were good. For entree most of us had ropa vieja with white rice, really delicious and flavorful, a decent portion as well. Desert was tres leches for some, which was so moist and fresh. For myself, I had a cappuccino which was a bit off for me, it tasted salty which is odd. The service was great but we were also the only ones in the restaurant most of the time. I do have to admit I think it is a bit overpriced. And I failed to notice gratuity was included on the bill already, we ended up giving double tip when I looked at the receipt when I got home, sort of wish this had been highlighted either verbally or directly on the bill.",

They have raised their pricing, which I understand, but the quality of the product has also gone down as the pricing has gone up.  The service is always good and the ambiance is nice.  It is a great ambassador of the neighborhood, so I hope that the food improves.  People from all over come there and it is a really nice mix of people.  See photo of the Buccatini....there is only 3 shrimps and two bites of lobster...I couldn't find any crab...the photo is before anything was eaten, pretty lame when it used to contain lots of shrimp, crab and lobster!",

The fried chicken is delicious, with a nice crunchy, and the hot honey drizzle gives it a nice little kick. The collards are tender and have a hint of sweet. They are braised overnight and it shows in the flavor profile. The fries were good, but nothing special. A nice side to go with the fried chicken.\n\nService is outstanding, and well-paced, without being pushy or feeling rushed. The vibe is very cool and gives off a feel of eclectic and relaxed, mixed in with a little bit of soul and warmth. Well worth the train ride from Midtown. This place is one of my favorites for soul food with a spin. Great food and terrific service!",

When our cheese plate was dropped off, we didn\u2019t get to learn what cheeses we had. I asked a server that passed by a few minutes later and she said she\u2019d get someone to tell us, but that didn\u2019t happen. The cheeses were delicious, but I wish I know exactly what they were. The dish is also advertised as coming with honeycomb, but there was only a small amount of plain honey, and about 1 whole walnut worth of candied nut pieces and 4 small slices of baguette. Again, all delicious, but overall small. More bread and honey was brought upon request, for a charge. (I understand this, but also think there ought to be enough bread on the first run- and I\u2019m a generous cheese to bread ratio kind of person.)\nThe entrees were brought out when we were only half finished with our apps, which is what it is. Didn\u2019t bother me terribly, but there were plenty of open tables and it might have been 7:30, 7:45 at that point- no need to rush us. \nAt the price point of the restaurant, I\u2019d expect a more leisurely experience. \nAgain, we\u2019d return, the staff were friendly and the food was good, but I\u2019d hope these things may be improved upon.",

I\u2019d highly recommend requesting him when making a reservation.\n\nNot a single critical comment to make about the food. The tomato stracciatella salad was full of authentic flavor while remaining simple and fresh. The gluten free gnocchi used for dietary restrictions were big and fluffy & the perfect delivery mechanism for their outstanding pesto sauce. And their saut\u00e9ed spinach could convince anyone veggies are underrated.\n\nI really don\u2019t think you can go wrong here.\n\nPs.

We asked for it at least 4 times, including when the rest of our meal arrived. Our server never came back to ask how everything was. To me, that\u2019s critical for full-service restaurants.

Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing. I went for brunch on Easter with a friend. We both ordered the French toast and it was very, very dry, even though we had specifically mentioned to the waiter that we both wanted it creamy on the inside as French toast should be. The waiter took our orders back and returned within 5 minutes with 2 new orders. They were not much better, tasteless and soggy this time  (and not even hot) as if the chef had just poured plain milk over the bread to soften it. Obviously not coming back anytime soon.",

It\u2019s on a very tiny street in North Bergen, they don\u2019t have a parking lot but luckily on a Sunday later in the day there was street parking available. Very tiny restaurant decorated with a lot of celebrity portraits, they were playing the movie, the Misfits, and although it was fun, I\u2019m not really sure how it tied in with the restaurant, but that\u2019s OK. It was fun to look at.\nAll of the servers were very nice and attentive, although one thing that constantly annoys me in most restaurants in this country is that servers come and clear things off the table while you\u2019re in the middle of eating. That is something that servers should be taught not to do.\nMy husband and I shared a pizza, and he had a puttanesca pasta dish and I had an eggplant stocked with tomato and mozzarella for my Main Course. All were adequate, but nothing was really spectacular although there were components of things that were nice.\nThe pizza, which apparently is supposed to be done in a wood oven, was not very crisp, and was definitely under done. The sauce was moderately OK.\nMy eggplant stack looked beautiful when it came out. It was fried eggplant with tomato and cheese and an arugula salad on the top but nothing really was flavorful enough to stand on its own, and even when you eat the pieces together, there was really no seasoning. My husband said his pasta dish was very good, and he thinks that the pasta was homemade. That\u2019s always nice. He did say it was a little over salted but it did have capers and olives in it so of course it\u2019s going to be salty . We did not have dessert.\nI would definitely give the restaurant another try,",

We would have loved to have some bread to devour the delicious sauce but the only bread available is focaccia which you have to purchase. I would suggest offering a complimentary basket of bread as most Italian restaurants do. That was the only thing missing from a perfect meal.",

The entrees didn't come in the same time.\nThe restorant can obviously serve 30% people less, in chasing the profit the quality unfortunately goes down.",

The food continues to be very good - we love the cauliflower appetizer and the penne a la vodka.  We also enjoyed the beet salad and the angliotti.  And the desserts (chocolate souffle and tiramisu) were both outstanding!  The service was definitely improved from our last visit, but still a bit uneven.  While everyone is friendly, we had to ask a few times to get bread, and some of the timing from the kitchen and the servers seemed off.  At least this time they acknowledged it and made some accommodation for the inconveniences, which was very much appreciated.",

And the WAIT for the food to come out was too long. And it initially came out in segments instead of all at once. Then the last to arrive were of course the two entrees with mistakes that had to be sent back. Finally to top it off, the bill arrives to reflect 2 BOTTLES of Prosecco instead if 2 glasses that were actually ordered. A total disappointment and utterly embarrassing.

Initially it was quieter but sound levels gradually crept up as more patrons were seated.

The apps came out nice and quick but the mains took forever, we had to ask the server if they forgot about us.  Two tables sat after we'd finished our apps and they had their mains served before our arrived.  The cocktails and food were amazing, we'll come back, but maybe I'll order a burger instead of the ni\u00e7oise salad this time.",

Service was expedient, but there were a couple of issues, two of us ordered the Croques Madame, I asked for an over-easy egg and it was fried hard. My friend asked if she could substitute the salad for fries. An order of fries came out 15 minutes before her meal was served with the salad?? The other party ordered a side of bacon - a healthy portion, but inconsistently cooked, some almost burnt and other pieces were almost raw. Despite this, we enjoyed the meal overall and the mimosas were delicious! I would dine here again. Thank you!",

Croutons definitely comes with an \u201cs\u201d on the menu\u2026.Service was very good, very nice place, too bad, really wanted to love that place to have a French restaurant nearby to go to to eat food from home, we won\u2019t be back unfortunately.",

I\u2019m not sure if this is a new thing but seeing dogs in the restaurant while I\u2019m eating feels unsanitary. If dogs need to be at a restaurant, I believe that they should be outside with their owners. I understand that people who require dogs as service animals is a different situation however, I am pretty sure that the dogs that I seen were not service animals and frankly, I prefer not to dine in any restaurant that allows dogs inside of the facility.

I loved that fact that 1 of the managers came around to check in on service he walked over to each table to say hello.\n\nThe food was really tasy and would definitely recommend our picks!\nItems selected from the menu includes\nFood:\n- crispy calamari\n- crab avocado\n- lobster roll (comes with fries)\nDrinks:\n- solstice\n- safe haven\n- innocent mojito\n\nWhy do I recommend:\n- great for all occasions\n- Bar has cocktails, cocktails, pitchers, wine and beer (perfect for all age group)\n- menu has a little bit of everything including option for (v, vg and gluten-free diets).\n- music\n- great for all kind of reservation ( family, friends, business)\n- right off 47 midbloc\n- supper clean dining area and restroom\n\nTip:\nDepending on your time of arrival reservations are a must!\nreminder this is a roof top restaurant.  Which means you need to first enter the hotel.  Stop at the hostess/concierge desk check in at which you will be directed to the roof top elevator.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for suggestions!

It was just my friend and I and so we had a really small table and we were seated next to the bar so it was quite loud and we kept getting passed by with the other patrons and staff.

The team did a great job creating a beautiful & comforting ambience for both indoor & outdoor seating. The servers were very nice & generally attentive but they could use one or two more. There were a lot of people who seemed like employees at the bar but only one server that actually waited on the tables. \n\nThe food came quickly, was plated beautifully, and tasted great! However, the price points at this restaurant doesn't seem to align to the actual dishes. There is an expectation to pay at a higher range when eating at a nice restaurant in this area but it's almost a little bizarre. Upwards of $26 for a brunch plate that is not filling, does not contain special or particularly expensive ingredients, and is not 'unique' in any way just comes off as a restaurant that is taking advantage of customers' willingness to pay more.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience but I don't think I would ever find myself here casually and I would always mention the price point when recommending to a friend.",

For me, the food was great! Drinks were ok. The waiter seemed not to understand what the tip service was when we asked and he said not sure they are just adding it for valentines special. The wording on the bill was confusing as it seemed too small for a tip- w thought it might be some kind of alcohol service tip so when we asked we didn\u2019t get a clean answer until we said is this your tip? And he said yes. I felt bad cause my experience in Manhattan was awesome and I brought a different friend to this location and it felt like I had hyped the restaurant too much LOL will be back to one in Manhattan- not this one so much.",

He then worked with us to find a meal option that was safe. We picked something off the menu, he went back to the kitchen to confirm and when there was a cross contamination warning on the box of pasta, he offered a safe substitution.

She chose to tell me that all the tables were that loud and that we would not fit in a booth, I cajoled her into moving us to one of the many available tables and it was fine from there, however unprofessional and unacceptable for a New York restaurant. Waiter was lovely, positive upbeat (although perhaps, overworked as drinks would come late) recommended some appetizers. the potato chips were decadent The broccoli was delicious entertaining guests from out of town who were visiting FIT. They enjoyed their filet mignon. I enjoyed my spring peas salad. The booth was great. The ambience is consistent and look and feel with other locations.

The salmon tar tar was amazing calamari also excellent.\nMy son was pleased with his steak.\nIt was a fun experience once I got used to the noise.\nThe restaurant also has a Photo Booth in the basement.

For the second time coming here, we were in and out in less than an hour. We used to come up here for celebratory brunches after racing but for the cost and how much we were shuffled out; it's not worth it. What most disappointed me was when I had my fork in my hand and I took a moment to chat with my boyfriend in between mouthfuls and the server asked me if I was done with my food. There was still food on the plate and my fork is still in my hand. Just not worth it with the cost of food; waste of money.",

He went on to explain the menu and how the food is coursed. Straight to the point no frills type of service. If I was a tourist, I probably would of felt a little rushed to close out the night. Stella Artois are $7/bottle. Arturo also swapped our grill top for a cleaner, less burnt one.\n\nThe apps were phenomenal. Soups, salads etc. Proteins were seasoned well. The idea of cooking dinner table side is engaging and fun. I will be back to try the meat lovers option.",

Our fries and onions rings arrived first while rest of our entrees came out much later and fries and onion rings were cold by then. Requested fresh fries and onion rings.... fries were great but onion rings for which we waited 15 minutes arrived as we finished our meal were the rejects.  Blobs of onion and batter stuck to each other and no one at the table  could eat.  Disappointing as cost was $10.  Server too busy to care and the 2 persons taking food from kitchen and giving to server for our table clearly do no quality control.  Wish I had taken a picture to post.  To top it off, we were charged for 2 onion rings!! \n\nWe planned to go back the next day for breakfast but the experience the evening before deterred us.",

The occasion involved a birthday and the celebrant wanted her usual favorite, coq au vin, which has been, heretofore, the best on the upper westside. Let's just say it was a mysterious conglomeration of undercooked vegetables and overcooked meat in a very strange tasting 'sauce' (hint: liquid smoke, not red wine). The restaurant was amazing, took it back, did not charge. Bravi. Rest of the meal was ok, not up to the usual standard. Arugula salad was limp, sour dressing. Bread = brilliant. French fries (also a BD request) were chewy, not crisp, suggesting reheated or old potatoes to start with. No complaints from others present about their meal and the wine was fantastic. They won't lose my business, but since you ask, now you know. Perhaps a new, tired or lazy chef.",

To make the night even more special, our waiter helped us select some staples from the menu and some specials which included a delicious beet root salad, Escargots en Croute, truffled hand-cut fries, house Chicken Liver Pate, Halibut with creamy polenta that was cooked to perfection and Duck Confit over basil pistou risotto - mouthwatering! To top off this amazing culinary experience, we were treated with a succulent profiterole accompanied by singing from both the GM and staff. French Roast New York is an absolute must-have on your New York restaurant list - five stars all around!",

My wife and I were pleasantly surpised when we got there to find it was an Israeli restaurant.   Sophia, our waitress, did an excellent job guiding us through the culinary experience.  The smoked trout special and taboon bread made a delicious appetizer.  My wife had the Lamb Kebab Halabi.  She said it was over the moon.  I was torn between the branzino and the whole Dorade entrees.  After discussing with Sophia, I  decided on the whole dorade.  It didn't disappoint. \nIt was exquisitely seasoned and the taste was tantalizing.  We finished the culinary journey, by sharing the flourless chocale cake.  The whole experience was unbelievably great.",

But this is the first time we were not happy with our server. Usually the service is warm and upbeat and we've commented what a good job the restaurant does at hiring staff, but last night's server had a clipped just-being-efficient attitude. When our first round of appetizers was delivered I realized I'd ordered the wrong salad...wanted the gem salad instead of the Greek. Before the salad was even placed on the table I acknowledged my mistake and asked if it was possible to exchange the salad. \"I'll ask the kitchen,\" our server said, \"but we won't be able to serve this one. We'll have to throw it out!\" I wasn't asking for an admonishment, just if I could switch the salad. (which she did do.) The other disappointment was that we were sitting in the back patio area along the 'tent wall' and it rained heavily during our meal. The floor beneath and around our table flooded and by the end of the meal we had wet shoes and our feet were cold and out umbrellas on the ground were soaked. That's not likely to happen again...but along with the server, it did not make for as warm and lovely an evening as we usually expect from what's a favorite neighborhood restaurant.",

I shared a lamb dish with two types of lentils and had a ground chicken sambusa. The sambusa was the best appetizer I've ever had, accompanied by two delicious sauces, one green, one red. The red tasted heavy with paprika. I couldn't quite place the flavors in the green one, but not like the green chutney you'd find in an Indian restaurant, which is what you might expect by visual inspection. I also had two cups of Kenyan black tea. I'd go back to NYC just to eat here again.",

Discovered that the lunch menu (and prices) was not available on Sundays.  As this was not what we budgeted for, we had to leave,  having made a wasted trek into NYC, including costs of gas and tolls.  The waitress,  who was the only worker, was unable to offer anything more than a call from the manager another day.  Very disappointing.",
